  <title>Kernel of Analysis</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> A point is <em>arbitrarily close</em> to a set when every neighborhood of the point intersects the set. </p>
     <p> This notation of <em>arbitrarily close</em> provides the theme of the book and the kernel of analysis. It allows 
      us to build a foundation for classic results in real analysis dealing with closure, limits and convergence, 
      connectedness, continuity, differentiation and integration. </p>
